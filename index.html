	<h2> Hello There! My name is Fred Alcala. </h2>
  <p> My career path is ready for a change, as I am beginning my journey as a computer programmer and willing to learn new skills
  and languages to increase my skills and to be the best programmer I can be! </p>
  <p> Here are some of the reasons why I decided to switch over to the intricate world of coding: </p>
	 <ul>
	<li> Coding is career that challenges me to learn to skills on the regular. </li>
	<li> Coding would allow me to create amazing software and websites that I can take pride in. </li>
	<li> Coding is the future! The more the world moves to full digital integration, the more in demand 
		these jobs are going to be. </li>

	  <h2> About Me </h2>
		   <h3> Career Path </h3>
		   <p> I attended <em> The University of Texas at El Paso </em> to pursue my Bachelors in Business Administration in Marketing.
	In my senior year, I was considering switching over to Computer Science, but I lacked the funds or means
	to be set back a couple of years. After graduation, I managed to get hired at one of the biggest financial firms
	in the world, Vanguard. After some time at Vanguard, I realized that my role was not something I wanted to commit
	an entire career to, so I left and wanted to dive deeper into the world of programming. Now, I am slowly learning
	what it takes to break into this new space that has interested me for the longest time. Collaborating with more experienced programmers
	is something I look forward to in my future place of employment. </p>

		   <h3> Outside activities </h3>
		   <p> Outside of my career, some things that I am <strong> very </strong> interested in are: </p>
		   <ul>
			   <li> Basketball </li>
			   <li> Video Games </li>
			   <li> Stocks and Crypto </li>
		   </ul>
		   <p> If a coworker talks about any of these things with me and I will most likely go on and on for a very long time. Someone will have
			   to interrupt us in order for us to get us back to work. </p>
